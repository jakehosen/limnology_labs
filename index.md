## Lab #1: Aug 29 & Sep 2. Introduction to R

### I've created two different ways to interact with this course material. For those who have little or no experience with R, start with Lab 1A and then move onto Lab 1B. If you have more advanced experience in R, start with Lab 1B and move onto Lab 1C. This is for more advanced R users, particularly graduate students in the class who already have some R modeling experience.

## Lab #1A: A brief introduction to R and RStudio.
If you have never used R and RStudio before, start with this brief introduction to RStudio basics. This will orient you to the RStudio interace.

Once you have completed this introduction, work this this brief set of exercises I've written to help you understand how you use R once you are familiar with the interace and and what you can do with R.
